# i2c-wasm-components
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a proof of concept of a potential WASI and I2C integration. 

The setup is as follows: Raspberry Pi 4 Model B → I2C Interface → HD44780 LCD. For this, wasmtime is leveraged. Support for the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller is on the roadmap.
